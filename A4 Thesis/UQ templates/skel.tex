In accordance with the requirements of the degree of Bachelor of
Engineering (Pass/Honours) in the division of Computer Systems
Engineering / Electrical and Electronic Engineering, I present the
following thesis entitled ``\ldots''.  This work was performed [in
partnership with Mr/Ms \ldots\ and] under the supervision of
Mr/Ms/Dr/A/Prof./Prof.~\ldots.

I declare that the work submitted in this thesis is my own, except as
acknowledged in the text and footnotes, and has not been previously
submitted for a degree at the University of Queensland or any other
institution.

\chapter{Acknowledgments}

Acknowledge your supervisor, preferably with a few short and specific
statements about his/her contribution to the content and direction of
the project.  If you collaborated with another student, acknowledge
your partner's contribution, including any parts of the thesis of
which s/he was the principal author or co-author; this information can
be duplicated in footnotes to the chapters or sections to which your
partner has contributed.  Briefly describe any assistance that you
received from technical or administrative staff.  Support of family
and friends may also be acknowledged, but avoid sentimentality---or
hide it in the dedication.

\chapter{Abstract}

% Notice that all \include files are chapters -- a logical division.
% But not all chapters are \include files; some chapters are short
% enough to be in-lined in the main file.

This document is a skeleton thesis for 4th-year students.  The
printable versions (\texttt{skel.dvi, skel.ps, skel.pdf})
show the structure of a typical thesis with some notes on the content
and purpose of each part.  The notes are meant to be informative but
not necessarily illustrative; for example, this paragraph is not
really an abstract, because it contains information not found
elsewhere in the document.  The \LaTeXe\ source file
(\texttt{skel.tex}) contains some non-printing comments giving
additional information for students who wish to typeset their theses
in \LaTeX.  You can download the source, edit out the unwanted
material, insert your own frontmatter and bibliographic entries, and
in-line or \verb+\include{}+ your own chapter files.  Of course the
content of a particular thesis will influence the form to a large
extent.  Hence this document should not be seen as an attempt to force
every thesis into the same mold.  If in doubt about the structure of
your thesis, seek advice from your supervisor.

\mainmatter
% By default, mainmatter has Arabic page-numbering (1,2,...).


% Chapters may be \include files, each beginning with a line like

%	\chapter{Title of chapter}
%
% e.g. if two chapter files were called intro.tex and theory.tex,
% we would say
%
%	\include{intro}
%	\include{theory}

\chapter{Introduction}

The introductory chapter describes the importance of the field and the
scope and significance of your project.  It usually ends with an
overview of the remainder of the thesis.

Notice that Arabic page numbering begins with Chapter 1.  Preceding
pages (known as ``frontmatter'') have Roman numbering.  The
\texttt{book} document class in \LaTeX\ follows this numbering
convention by default (see Lamport~\cite{lamport}, p.\,80).

\chapter{Literature review / prior art}

You will need to review previous work in the field, which may include
books and papers (``literature''), patents and commercial products
(``prior art''), and earlier work in your Department.  This
information is usually (but not always) collected in a single chapter,
whose title should preferably be more specific and interesting than
the one above.

\chapter{Theory}

A scientific paper is likely to be read by people who are not
specialists in the same field as the author(s), but who nevertheless
may need to use the results of the paper in their own fields.
Similarly, the examiners of your thesis will probably include at least
one academic who does not teach or conduct research in the subject
area of your thesis.  In an early chapter of your thesis, therefore,
you should quote any theoretical results which are necessary for the
understanding of later chapters.  Examiners who are not specialists in
your area will know whether you have given sufficient theoretical
information.  They will also know whether you have insulted their
status by presenting material which is familiar to every
half-competent graduate in every field of ECE.

\chapter{Methodology, procedure, design, etc.}

This may be one chapter or several.  Again, titles should be more
informative than the above.

You will almost certainly need diagrams to clarify your meaning.  The
\LaTeXe\ \texttt{graphics} package allows the inclusion of PostScript
graphics, as in \fig{flr1}.  The inclusion of \LaTeX\ \texttt{picture}
graphics, as in \fig{fzsys}, requires no auxiliary packages and allows
the mathematical formatting features of \LaTeX\ to be used in
diagrams; but the \texttt{picture} files, unlike PostScript files,
usually require manual editing.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\input{fzsys.latex}
\caption{Modeling a discrete-time LTI system using $z$-transforms}
\label{fzsys}
\end{figure}

\chapter{Results and discussion \ldots}

\ldots\ or perhaps the discussion should be a separate chapter.

In any case, you will probably need to include tabulated results.
\tab{tf2} illustrates the use of various \LaTeX\ environments to
include a computer printout (plain text file) in a document.  The
\texttt{verbatim} environment, which encloses the formatted text, is
also useful for program listings.

\appendix

% Chapters after the \appendix command are lettered, not numbered.
% Setting apart the appendices in the table of contents is awkward:

\newpage
\addcontentsline{toc}{part}{Appendices}
\mbox{}
\newpage

% The \mbox{} command between two \newpage commands gives a blank page.
% In the contents, the ``Appendices'' heading is shown as being on this
% blank page, which is the page before the first appendix.  This stops the
% first appendix from be listed ABOVE the word ``Appendices'' in the
% table of contents.

% \include appendix chapters here.

\chapter{Dummy appendix}

Appendices are useful for supplying necessary details or explanations
which do not seem to fit into the main text, perhaps because they are
too long and would distract the reader from the central argument.
Appendices are also used for program listings.

Notice that appendices are ``numbered'' with capital letters, not
numerals.  When the \verb+\appendix+ command in
\LaTeX~\cite[p.\,175]{lamport} is used with the \texttt{book} document
class, it causes subsequent chapters to be treated as appendices.

\chapter{Program listings}

\section{First program}

Some initial explanatory notes may precede the listing.

\section{Etc.}

\chapter{Companion disk}

If you wish to make some computer files available to your examiners,
you can list and describe the files here.  The files can be supplied
on a disk and inserted in a pocket fixed to the inside back cover.

The disk will not be needed if you can specify a URL from which the
files can be downloaded.
